These are my custom [karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en) settings.

## Modified Home Row Arrow and Modifier Mode
* I changed the keycodes for the settings I was interested in to support **Dvorak** keyboard layout.
 * I used some newer **Karabiner** settings to mostly eliminate the touch typing lag that using spacebar as a modifier caused in the original version. However, if you have not typed any keys for the threshold time, the lag on space is still somewhat annoying
 * I changed tap A to be ctrl-click

## Bracket chords
I added the following chords (lowercase is the dvorak, uppercase the labels on the keys):
````
 eu(SD) => (
 ht(JK) => [
 tn(KL) => {
```

However I may end up changing these because  `th` and `nt` are fast rollovers on dvorak. I will see whether I adjust or not.
